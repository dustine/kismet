# Change Log
All notable changes to this project, and henceforth the mod, will be documented on this file.

This project adheres to a modified version of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), to accommodate to the specific nature of the Minecraft modding environment, more concretely categorizing Major changes as API changing or Mod changing (leading to world issues).

Details about this versioning system can be found [here (original version)](http://mcforge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/conventions/versioning/#versioning) and here (modified version used on this ), although release candidates and final denotations will use `+` instead of `-` to adhere back to Semver.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- The whole mod, basically :tongue:
   - "Daily" challenges to fetch or create a mod-specific item, submitted to a Timed Kismetic Display
      - Duration can be changed in the config options
      - Untimed version also possible
      - JEI integration that shows the recipe of the object currently in
   - "Key" item to force the display to change, without cost (well, besides the key itself)
